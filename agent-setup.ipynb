    "    - CryptoPanic: A provider for news and social media posts in DeFi\n",

    "Directly mention the kind of data you need (sentiment-related, volatility-related) or any category-specific data.\n",

    "This agent generates a data-driven analysis and evaluation of the data while using suitable methodologies (STARE, CAR , SOAR, IDEA frameworks). \n",
    "It is smart enough to understand the context of the data and provide insights based on the data.\n",

    "  - Analyze technical indicators such as RSI, MACD, and SMA to predict movements\n",
    "  - Interpret social media metrics to gauge market sentiment and mindshare\n",
